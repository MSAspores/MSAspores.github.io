## Increasing Diversity at MSA through Mentorship
 
Diverse scientific visions enrich communities and lead to novel ideas for research, education, and outreach. However, the vast majority of scientific communities tend to be white and male-dominated. The Mycological Society of America (MSA) is no exception and faces severe issues of gender imbalance (Branco and Vellinga, 2015) and overall underrepresentation, with a majority of MSA members being white, cis-gender, heterosexual, and male (Cheeke et al. 2018). One of the barriers leading to inequity that requires attention is our ability to recruit and retain the diversity of membership.
 
As an effort to diversify MSA membership, we created the SPORES program (Society Prioritizes Our Recruitment of Every Scholar).
