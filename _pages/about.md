**SPORES (Society Prioritizes Our Recruitment of Every Scholar)** aims to attract undergraduate students from underrepresented and underserved communities (**mentees**) to attend the annual [Mycological Society of America](https://msafungi.org/) meeting and become MSA members. We will recruit established MSA members to act as **mentors** (PhD students, or mycologists with PhDs) to introduce and guide mentees at the MSA annual meeting, facilitating friendly and productive experiences with the goal of leading to long-term MSA membership and participation.  

## Mission  

The mission of SPORES is to provide opportunities for first-time undergraduate students to be introduced to MSA by current mycologists (mentors) in a friendly and constructive environment, promoting a sense of belonging in society with the goal of retaining them as long-term members. To accomplish the mission of SPORES, we request MSAâ€™s support mentee membership and annual meeting attendance. By providing financial aid, MSA will actively invest in its mission of promoting science equity and diversity in the society.
